# STAPLE Dashboard

This project is to create a playground for displaying STAPLE project data in an informative way.

## Development

We use Vite to develop. If you have node installed, all you need to do after cloning the repo:

```sh
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

And you should be good to go! If not, feel free to open an issue.

For reference, we use [Tremor.so](https://tremor.so/docs/visualizations/donut-chart) to build up some of the dashboard capabilities and an initial experiment was done over at <https://staple.science/project-summary-v1/people_roles>.
